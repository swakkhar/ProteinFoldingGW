To compile we need to go at "ga" directory and then the command is: javac *.java
To run we need to go at "vPW" directory and then the command is:
java ga.Main [Benchmark_index] [No_of_runs] [File_start_index] [Population_size]

Benchmark_index is 0 to 16 to select from following benchmarks and default benchmark index is 16:
0 --- 4RXN
1 --- 1ENH
2 --- 4PTI
3 --- 2IGD
4 --- 1YPA
5 --- 1R69
6 --- 1CTF
7 --- 3MX7
8 ---- 3NBM
9 ---- 3MQO
10 ---- 3MR0
11 ---- 3PNX
12 --- 3MSE
13 ---- 3MR7
14 ---- 3NO6
15 ---- 3NO3
16 ---- 3ON7

Default No_of_runs is 55.

Default File_start_index is 1.

Defalut Population size is 50.
